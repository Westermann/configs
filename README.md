# configs

Cheers, Jonas

__Warning: These are just my config and settings files I like to use when I am on a new system. You can look at them but it's probably not smart to run the setup script since it will overwrite your existing configs.__

## Requirements
* [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) should be installed
* Obviously, git should be installed
* curl is required
* R should be installed
* Vim should be installed
* [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) should be installed

## Usage
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Westermann/configs/master/setup_configs.sh | sh`
